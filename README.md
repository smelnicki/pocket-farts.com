Because... who wouldn't want a progressive web fart app?


### Quickstart

You'll need to have node and npm already installed. I use v5.9.0 and 3.7.3, respectively.

On mac, I recommend installing via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
```
brew install node

node --version
npm --version
```

Then, to get up and running:
```
npm install     # install all required dependencies
npm start       # compiles source and starts up a server at http://localhost:3000
```


### Installation

To try it out live, navigate to [pocket-farts.com](https://pocket-farts.com).

If you're on safari, you can install via the 'add to homescreen button'

![add-to-homescreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smelnicki/pocket-farts.com/master/screenshots/add-to-homescreen.gif)

If you're on android, you'll receive a prompt to save to the homescreen during your second visit, provided
at least five minutes have passed.

Unfortunately, I still need to download android studio, so android screenshots are still pending.
